				<p>2018 - 2025<br>
					<em>Tucson, Arizona, USA</em><br>
					<p>
					Developed an innovative method using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms for analyzing borehole televiewer data to identify rock fracture orientation trends. This method enhances slope stability analysis by automating the clustering of similar fracture orientations, overcoming the limitations of traditional manual methods that are subjective and time-consuming. It provides a reproducible and efficient approach to characterizing rock fabric.
					</p>
					<p>
					Developed DronePlan3D, a custom flight planning software for drones, to enhance geologic data collection in open-pit mines. This innovation overcame limitations of existing solutions by maintaining a constant ground sampling distance across varying topographies, thus ensuring consistent point cloud resolution and capturing geologic structures on vertical bench faces effectively. The solution provided significant value to mines by delivering high-resolution and accurate point clouds that can be utilized for remote geotechnical structure mapping and long-term slope movement monitoring.
