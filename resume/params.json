Responsibilities include site investigations, rock-mass and strength characterization, slope stability analysis, and report preparation. Areas of specialization include probabilistic, and limit-equilibrium slope stability models. Major projects include the Pinto Valley Mine (Arizona, USA), Candelaria Mine (Atacama Region, Chile), Bingham Mine (Utah, USA), and Rosemont Mine (Arizona, USA).\r\n\r\n### Geotechnical Engineer, KGHM International, Robinson Project\r\n2012 - 2013  \r\n*Ely, Nevada, USA*  \r\nOn-site geotechnical engineer focusing on slope monitoring, project management, and stability analysis. Managed multiple geotechnical drill programs. Installed and monitored various slope stability programs to predict and prevent slope instabilities. Experience with Robotic Total Stations, Slope Stability Radar, Time Domain Reflectometers, and LIDAR. Performed multiple back-analyses of previous slope failures and instabilities to determine geotechnical parameters of various geotechnical domains. Recommended slope angles using 2-dimensional limit equilibrium models. Recommended safe operational designs to mitigate rockfall hazards. Maintained a positive relationship between the technical services group and operations group to accomplish mutually beneficial goals.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n+ Completed MSHA surface metal/nonmetal mine health and safety training.\r\n+ Experience with Reutech MSR300, GroundProbe SSR-XT, IBIS-FM, Leica TM30/TM50, Optech ILRIS-3D, TDR100.\r\n+ Expert level competency with SLOPE/W, AutoCAD, MineSight, JavaScript and Python.\r\n+ Working knowledge of Rocscience programs include Slide 6.0, RocFall, RocPlane, and Swedge.",
